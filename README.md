TOP landing page assignment
# Whew! i spent entierly too much time fussing with this, that being said i learned a lot with my first landing page project. i had the sizing right for mobile and all screen adjustment. unfortunatly i changed some other code. something went wrong and ive spent hours trying to fix it. i think its time to move on but future me. if youre looking back at this and know how to fix the issue now...please do that. the problem is in the    .mainbody{} section. the images won't wrap.
